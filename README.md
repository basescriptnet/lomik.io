## Lomik.io
Lomik.io is a very simple game based on diep.io's idea - survive for as long as you can! It is similar by classes and styles, but it has major differences:
1. Castle
    You need to protect your castle, or else you will lose whole the game
2. Day/night switches
    At the beginning you have a bit of time to collect some score and to level up, but later on you will face troubles of night
3. Bots
    Once the night hits, bots will attack you and your castle, so you need to level up to be able to protect your castle
4. Bosses
    Depending on the game mode you choose, you will face a very strong boss once in a while. With the default gun it's pretty hard to do, so try to level up as fast as you can
5. New geometric figures
    For now we have the hexagon in the game, but later on we will have more and more interesting shapes, that will work in advantage to the player by damaging the bots

## Play totally for FREE
